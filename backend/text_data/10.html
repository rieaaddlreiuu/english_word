    In statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a class of algorithms used to draw samples from a probability
    distribution. Given a probability distribution, one can construct a Markov chain whose elements' distribution
    approximates it – that is, the Markov chain's equilibrium distribution matches the target distribution. The more
    steps that are included, the more closely the distribution of the sample matches the actual desired distribution.

    Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to study probability distributions that are too complex or too highly
    dimensional to study with analytic techniques alone. Various algorithms exist for constructing such Markov chains,
    including the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm.

    MCMC methods are primarily used for calculating numerical approximations of multi-dimensional integrals, for example
    in Bayesian statistics, computational physics, computational biology and computational linguistics.

    In Bayesian statistics, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are typically used to calculate moments and credible
    intervals
    of posterior probability distributions. The use of MCMC methods makes it possible to compute large hierarchical
    models
    that require integrations over hundreds to thousands of unknown parameters.

    In rare event sampling, they are also used for generating samples that gradually populate the rare failure region.

    Markov chain Monte Carlo methods create samples from a continuous random variable, with probability density
    proportional
    to a known function. These samples can be used to evaluate an integral over that variable, as its expected value or
    variance.

    Practically, an ensemble of chains is generally developed, starting from a set of points arbitrarily chosen and
    sufficiently distant from each other. These chains are stochastic processes of "walkers" which move around randomly
    according to an algorithm that looks for places with a reasonably high contribution to the integral to move into
    next,
    assigning them higher probabilities.

    Random walk Monte Carlo methods are a kind of random simulation or Monte Carlo method. However, whereas the random
    samples of the integrand used in a conventional Monte Carlo integration are statistically independent, those used in
    MCMC are autocorrelated. Correlations of samples introduces the need to use the Markov chain central limit theorem
    when
    estimating the error of mean values.

    These algorithms create Markov chains such that they have an equilibrium distribution which is proportional to the
    function given.
