<div class="sentence">
    In mathematics, the Seifertâ€“Van Kampen theorem of algebraic topology (named after Herbert Seifert and Egbert van
    Kampen),
    sometimes just called Van Kampen's theorem, expresses the structure of the fundamental group of a topological space
    X in terms of the fundamental groups of two open,
    path-connected subspaces that cover X.
    It can therefore be used for computations of the fundamental group of spaces that are constructed out of simpler
    ones.
